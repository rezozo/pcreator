PCreator (Project Creator)
---

##What is this thing?
It's a terminal-based project scaffolder, like the one in IntelliJ but with less (or more?) library support for JavaScript.

##Why have you created it? There's Yeoman for this stuff...
Because:

1. I'm lazy and I needed a simple solution to create new projects
2. I don't like the method yeoman does its scaffolding with (installing generators for everything sucks!)
3. I was bored in the afternoon and it seemed like a good idea.

##Why Project Creator? It's basically a scaffolder
Beacuse Project Creator sounds a lot better than Project Scaffolder.

##Where do I sign up?
You don't need to sign up (yet...)! Just follow the tutorial:
